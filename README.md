## Description
Travelog is a travel diary site where users can view, post, edit, and delete posts that include information about places they've traveled to. The data model for each post will be an "Entry", and each entry may include a place, a landmark, an image, and dates. Data for the app will be stored, retrieved from, added to, and deleted from the Mongo Database site connected via the Mongoose ODM library. The site is built using RESTFul routes architecture using JavaScript, a Node environment, Express framework, React library, and styled using SCSS and CSS.
